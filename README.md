👋 **Hi, I’m @nnagarajan**

Software engineer with a focus on **data engineering, scalable systems, and applied machine learning**. I build and open-source tools and frameworks that help teams streamline data pipelines, enhance observability, and solve real-world problems across the data stack.

🔭 **What I’m Working On**

I’m currently building and contributing to projects that span:

- **Blockchain & smart contracts** (e.g., auction mechanisms)
- **Data processing frameworks with real-time and batch capabilities**
- **Formatting & tooling for enterprise-grade data systems**
- **Applied deep learning in domain-specific contexts**

💡 **Highlights from My Work**
📦 **Featured Projects**

- **chain-treasury-auction** – Smart contract for treasury bond auctions using Solidity.
- **gg-custom-formatters** – Custom GoldenGate transactional formatters to extend and enhance CDC workflows in Java.
- **DNNLOB-FA800** – Deep neural network model for financial time-series forecasting and execution strategies.
- **transactional-cdc-processing-spark** – Scalable Scala/Apache Spark pipelines for transactional CDC workloads.

🚀 **Skills & Technologies**

- **Languages**: Scala, Java, Python, Solidity
- **Data**: Spark, Kafka, CDC / streaming data
- **Machine Learning**: Deep learning research & prototype notebooks
- **Tooling**: Formatters, custom integrations, observability
